# svg-turtle #

a turtle graphics library with SVG output

`svg-turtle` is a small JavaScript library (written in TypeScript) to create [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) with [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) output. While it may well be used to create "ordinary" graphics, it is primarily intended to create projects for cutting plotters.

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/svg-turtle/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

> Just a small note: if you like this module and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.

## Installation ##

`svg-turtle` may be used as an ECMAScript module (ESM), a CommonJS or AMD module or from a global variable.

You may either install the package into your build environment using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) with the command

```
npm install svg-turtle
```

or load the plain script file directly

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/svg-turtle"></script>
```

## Access ##

How to access the package depends on the type of module you prefer

* ESM (or Svelte): `import { Graphic } from 'svg-turtle'`
* CommonJS: `const SVGTurtle = require('svg-turtle')`
* AMD: `require(['svg-turtle'], (SVGTurtle) => {...})`

Alternatively, you may access the global variable `SVGTurtle` directly.

## Usage within Svelte ##

For Svelte it is recommended to import the package within a module context:

```html
<script context="module">
  import Graphic from 'svg-turtle'
</script>

<script>
  let SVG = new Graphic().moveTo(10,10).draw(10).curveRight(90,10).draw(10).asSVG()
</script>
```

## Usage as ECMAscript Module ##

If you prefer ESMs, just import the library and use it:

```html
<script>
  import { Graphic } from 'svg-turtle'

  window.onload = function () {
    let SVG = new Graphic().moveTo(10,10).draw(10).curveRight(90,10).draw(10).asSVG()
    ...
  }
</script>
```

## Usage as CommonJS or AMD Module (or as a global Variable) ##

Let's assume that you already "required" or "imported" (or simply loaded) the module according to your local environment. In that case, you may use it as follows:

```html
<script>
  const { Graphic } = SVGTurtle

  window.onload = function () {
    let SVG = new Graphic().moveTo(10,10).draw(10).curveRight(90,10).draw(10).asSVG()
    ...
  }
</script>
```

## Example ##

A [simple example](https://svelte.dev/repl/e3d91abc0a3d4a6fb2204b8e756e3b3c) is available on the Svelte REPL - feel free to play with it!

## API Reference ##

As shown in the code examples above, every graphic is represented by an instance of class `Graphic` - each of which may contain multiple "paths".

A **typical workflow** looks as follows:

* create an instance of class `Graphic`,
* define one or multiple "paths",
* render the instance as SVG - if need be, with proper scaling for cutting plotters

### exported Types ###

* **`type TUR_Location = number`**<br>represents an optionally signed finite number to be used as an x or y coordinate
* **`type TUR_Dimension = number`**<br>represents a finite number â‰¥ 0 to be used as a dimension (i.e., width or height)
* **`type TUR_Angle = number`**<br>represents an optionally signed finite number to be used as an angle (given in degrees, positive values rotate clockwise, negative ones counterclockwise)
* **`type TUR_Color = string`**<br>represents a literal CSS/SVG-compliant color specification (such as "red" or "#FF0000")
* **`type TUR_Lineature = 'solid'|'dotted'|'dashed'`**<br>represents a specifies line type
* **`type TUR_Join = 'bevel'|'miter'|'round'`**<br>represents a line join type
* **`type TUR_Cap = 'butt'|'round'|'square'`**<br>represents a line end type
* **`type TUR_PathOptionSet = {`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`x?:TUR_Location, y?:TUR_Location, Direction?:TUR_Angle,`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`Width?:TUR_Dimension, Color?:TUR_Color, Fill?:TUR_Color,`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`Lineature?:TUR_Lineature, Join?:TUR_Join, Cap?:TUR_Cap`**<br>
  **`}`**<br>represents a set of options which may be used to initialize a new path
* **`type TUR_Position = { x:TUR_Location, y:TUR_Location }`**<br>represents a position of the turtle, given by its x and y coordinates - but whithout specifying its orientation
* **`type TUR_Alignment = { x:TUR_Location, y:TUR_Location, Direction:TUR_Angle }`**<br>represents a position and orientation of the turtle, given by its x and y coordinates and its orientation measured in degrees against the x-axis (positive values describe a clockwise, negative ones a counterclockwise rotation)

### Class Graphic ###

Class `Graphic` has a single parameterless constructor. After instantiation (or, later, after a `reset`), its settings contain the following defaults:

* `x,y`: `0,0` (at coordinate origin)
* `Direction`: `0` (in direction of the x-axis)<br>&nbsp;
* `Width`: 1
* `Color`: `#000000`
* `Fill`: `none`
* `Lineature`: `solid`
* `Join`: `round`
* `Cap`: `round`

Many methods return the instance they were applied to in the end - this may be used to immediately concatenate multiple method invocations (sometimes called a **fluent API**)

* **`reset ():Graphic`**<br>sets turtle position, orientation and line properties to their defaults (as shown above)
* **`beginPath (PathOptionSet?:TUR_PathOptionSet):Graphic`**<br>starts a new path, beginning with the current turtle position,  orientation and line properties, optionally overwritten by any settings given in `PathOptionSet`
* **`turn (Anglee:TUR_Angle):Graphic`**<br>rotates the turtle relative to its current direction by the given `Angle` (specified in degrees). Positive angles rotate clockwise, negative ones counterclockwise. This method may be invoked outside an active path
* **`turnTo (Angle:TUR_Angle):Graphic`**<br>rotates the turtle "absolutely" (i.e. relative to the x-axis) to the given `Angle` (specified in degrees). Positive angles describe a clockwise, negative ones a counterclockwise rotation. This method may be invoked outside an active path
* **`turnLeft (Angle:TUR_Angle):Graphic`**<br>rotates the turtle counterclockwise by the given `Angle` (specified in degrees), equivalent to `turn(-Angle)`. This method may be invoked outside an active path
* **`turnRight (Angle:TUR_Angle):Graphic`**<br>rotates the turtle clockwise by the given Angle (specified in degrees). This method is just a synonym for `turn(Angle)`. It may be invoked outside an active path
* **`move (Distance:TUR_Location):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "relatively" (i.e., starting from its current position) in the current direction for `Distance` units without drawing. Positive values for `Distance` move forward, negative ones move backward. This method may be invoked outside an active path
* **`moveTo (x:TUR_Location, y:TUR_Location):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "absolutely" (i.e., measured from the origin) to the given position (keeping its current orientation) without drawing. This method may be invoked outside an active path
* **`draw (Distance:TUR_Location):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "relatively" (i.e., starting from its current position) in the current direction for `Distance` units drawing a straight line. Positive distances move forward, negative ones backward. If invoked outside an active path, a new path with the current turtle position, orientation and line style is started
* **`drawTo (x:TUR_Location, y:TUR_Location):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "absolutely" (i.e., measured from the origin) to the given position (keeping its current orientation) drawing a straight line. If invoked outside an active path, a new path with the current turtle position, orientation and line style is started
* **`curveLeft (Angle:TUR_Angle, rx:TUR_Dimension, ry?:TUR_Dimension):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "relatively" (i.e., starting from its current position) drawing a counterclockwise circular or elliptical arc for the given `Angle` with radius `rx` (in the current turtle direction) and `ry` (perpendicular to the current turtle direction). If `ry` is omitted, it defaults to `rx`. Positive angles move the turtle forward, negative angles backward. Finally, the turtle is positioned at the end of the arc and oriented tangentially to the arc. If invoked outside an active path, a new path with the current turtle position, orientation and line style is started
* **`curveRight (Angle:TUR_Angle, rx:TUR_Dimension, ry?:TUR_Dimension):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle "relatively" (i.e., starting from its current position) drawing a clockwise circular or elliptical arc for the given `Angle` with radius `rx` (in the current turtle direction) and `ry` (perpendicular to the current turtle direction). If `ry` is omitted, it defaults to `rx`. Positive angles move the turtle forward, negative angles backward. Finally, the turtle is positioned at the end of the arc and oriented tangentially to the arc. If invoked outside an active path, a new path with the current turtle position, orientation and line style is started
* **`endPath ():Graphic`**<br>ends the currently active path (if one is active). This method is "idempotent", i.e., it is save to end an already ended path
* **`closePath ():Graphic`**<br>closes the currently active path (if one is active), drawing a straight line to its starting point, and then ends it. This method is "idempotent", i.e., it is save to close an already ended path
* **`currentPosition ():TUR_Position`**<br>returns the current turtle position. This method may be used to remember a specific point on a turtle's path and move the turtle back to this position later
* **`positionAt (Position:TUR_Position):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle to the given position without changing its direction. It differs from `moveTo` insofar as you have to specify a `TUR_Position` rather than two separate coordinates
* **`currentAlignment ():TUR_Alignment`**<br>returns the current turtle position and orientation. This method may be used to remember a specific point and direction on a turtle's path and move the turtle back to this position with the given orientation later
* **`alignAt (Alignment:TUR_Alignment):Graphic`**<br>moves the turtle to the given position and changes its direction
*  **`Limits ():{ xMin:number, yMin:number, xMax:number, yMax:number}`**<br>returns current estimated viewport limits, based on the paths the `Graphic` instance contains
* **`public asSVG (`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`Unit?:'px'|'mm'|'cm'|'in',`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`xMin?:number,yMin?:number, xMax?:number,yMax?:number`**<br>
  **`):string`**<br>returns the SVG code for the underlying `Graphic` instance and all its paths, using the given `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin` and `yMax` values as viewport limits - any missing limit is estimated from the paths the `Graphic` instance contains. If the target system (e.g., a web browser) supports it, the resulting SVG will rendered using the given `Unit` (which defaults to `px`)
* **`public asSVGwith72dpi (`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`Unit?:'px'|'mm'|'cm'|'in',`**<br>
  &nbsp; **`xMin?:number,yMin?:number, xMax?:number,yMax?:number`**<br>
  **`):string`**<br>returns the SVG code for the underlying `Graphic` instance and all its paths, using the given `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin` and `yMax` values as viewport limits - any missing limit is estimated from the paths the `Graphic` instance contains. In contrast to `asSVG`, this method scales the output such that all coordinates and dimensions are multiples of 1/72 inch (depending on the given unit which defaults to `mm`)

## Usage with "Cricut Design Space" ##

The "Cricut Design Space" does not respect any units given in an SVG's `width` and `height` attributes but expects the numeric coordinates to be multiples of 1/72 of an inch. It is therefore recommended to export any turtle graphics using the `asSVGwith72dpi` method which scales the output as required by the application (based on the provided unit).

### Typical Workflow when using "Cricut Design Space" ###

Typically, within "Cricut Design Space", you will first

* upload the SVG generated by svg-turtle and then
* place it on the canvas for later plotting and cutting

Now, you should

* "ungroup" the full SVG in order to get the separate paths,
* these paths may now be individually selected in order to assign the proper tools (such as a knife for cutting or a scoring stylus or wheel for scoring)

If need be, you may also

* duplicate selected paths (for multiple cutting or scoring rounds) and then
* align all duplicates to their original left and top edges

Before plotting, you should not forget to

* attach all paths again for proper positioning on mat

Your project is now ready to be sent to your plotter.
